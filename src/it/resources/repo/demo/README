Data lineage for the demo solution: 

Requirements: 

Due to limitations of the current system you must add absolute paths to the solution files to connect them. 

1. Open launch_transformation.kjb. Add the path to the file_to_table.ktr in the transformation job entry. 
2. Open file_to_table.ktr. Add the path to the .csv (lives in the same directory as the .ktr) in the text file input step.
3. The table output step requires an H2 database embedded with sampledata database available. You can start one of these by running any BA Server's start_hypersonic script.
